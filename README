This is code which was used for extacting and analyzing data in 2011 for the Bilingual Aphasia Test Android app (Cook, Marquis, Achim 2011) presented at The Academy of Aphasia 2011 - Montreal. To know more about the archetecture and what Open Source projects were incorporated into this you can look at the Experimenter WebApp Diagram in this pdf:

For the updated code which we have continued to build and improve, see the https://github.com/iLanguage/OPrime project. This code is no longer maintained. 


There are some "WATCHME" YouTube Videos http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLF468B25FFEF8EAF9 to show what this project is and how it relates to the AndroidBilingualAphasiaTest project.  The code is also running with our data on the web. You can play with it here http://openlanguage.ca:8136/touch_response_visualizer.html


There was a "moderatly user friendly" Installer for Mac OS Snow Leopard which can be used to visualize the sample data and see what this code does. User be-warned: its a very young project, so like a baby it often bables, burps and sometimes spits up unexpectedly. Its very heavy 200MB but it sets up your laptop to do some significant data crunching. http://code.google.com/p/ilanguagelab/downloads/detail?name=OPrimeAdministratorInstaller_va3.zip&can=2&q= 

The Installer is unnecesary if you are familiar with the Terminal/Commandline. All the dependancies run on either Linux or Mac. Contact us if you would like some help setting it up: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dGpiRDhreGpmTFBmQ2FUTVVjVlhESHc6MQ
